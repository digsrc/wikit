Wikit is a "wiki wiki web" implementation, built with Tcl and MetaKit.
See http://www.equi4.com/starkit/wikit.html for details and news.

Wikit was written by Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com> and drives the
"Tcler's Wiki", an active collaborative resource <http://wiki.tcl.tk/>.

With many thanks to all contributors and authors of code used in Wikit:

      Steve Landers - improved markup for documentation, local mode
          Don Libes - cgi package
        Kevin Kenny - autoscroll package
    Andreas Kupries - documentation
    Colin McCormack - code refactoring
    Jos Decoster    - improved markup - incl. tables, backrefs, etc

IMPORTANT - Since 2007 the development of lib/wikit now occurs via
the Wub project at https://wikitcl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wikit

Wikit can be run in one of five modes
	- as a library via Wub - as in The Tclers Wiki (http://wiki.tcl.tk)
	- as a self-contained program via wikit's built-in web server 
	- as a CGI script run from Apache or TclHttpd or AOLserver
	- as a stand-alone program, with the rendering done by Tk
	- as an embedded portable help system for Starkits

The core wikit library code (lib/wikit) is now maintained via the
Wub/wikitcl project - i.e. being the code that runs the Tclers Wiki
(http://wiki.tcl.tk)

The remainder of this repository contains the code for running wikit
in the other modes, and as a Starkit - i.e. the dependent packages
(in ../lib) and the documentation (../doc).
