IMPORTANT - Since 2007 the development of lib/wikit now occurs via
the Wub project at https://wikitcl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wikit

Wikit can be run in one of five modes
	- as a library via Wub - as in The Tclers Wiki (http://wiki.tcl.tk)
	- as a self-contained program via wikit's built-in web server 
	- as a CGI script run from Apache or TclHttpd or AOLserver
	- as a stand-alone program, with the rendering done by Tk
	- as an embedded portable help system for Starkits

The core wikit library code (lib/wikit) is now maintained via the
Wub/wikitcl project - i.e. being the code that runs the Tclers Wiki
(http://wiki.tcl.tk)

The remainder of this repository contains the code for running wikit
in the other modes, and as a Starkit - i.e. the dependent packages
(in ../lib) and the documentation (../doc).
